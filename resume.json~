      "summary": "Develop systems swiftly and reliably has been ever harder. This is further aggravated with the popularization of multi-tier web-based applications, particularly those developed as RIA (Rich Internet Application). The Flex Framework is presented as a good alternative to creating these applications, however, to use Flex you need to study itself and other technologies such as AcionScript 3 and the AMF (to communicate with the server), resulting in a huge complexity during software development also increasing needs for concern about code reuse for creation and communication interfaces. With this in mind, we tried to build a framework where developer doesn’t need to know about Flex syntax. For such, use of metadata stored in a database was proposed, then, that can be interpreted by client layer using an architectural pattern-based Graphical Component Metadata and manage user interfaces, arranging service calls transparently to developer. This paper’s goal is show implementation of the client layer beyond the standards used to construct the same."
